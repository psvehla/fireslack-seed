This is the sample project used in [thinkster's](https://thinkster.io/) 'Learn to build a Real-Time Slack clone with AngularFire' [tute](https://thinkster.io/angularfire-slack-tutorial).

This is where I ended up at the end of the [tute](https://thinkster.io/angularfire-slack-tutorial). More for my own reference than anything else, but you're welcome to have a browse. There are commits at the end of most sections.
